Balloon Bash (BaloonBashASU.flv) captions -- you must use all three!:

In the Technical Imaging Lab, students explore high-speed imaging and video, and stroboscopic and thermal photography.

GIT's Introduction to Technical Imaging course explores the current high-speed and thermal imaging technologies, as well as what is on the horizon.

With technical imaging, students can understand science and technology through imaging, and make great imagery at the same time!


Lathe (LatheASU.flv) captions -- you must use both!:

High-speed imaging technology allows events, such as a machining lathe in action, to be captured that are not viewable with the naked eye.

Students use the tools and techniques of high-speed imaging to learn the essentials of planning and executing technical projects.
